<p>Helping developers become more comfortable and proficient with solving problems<br>
in the Hadoop space. People will become more familiar with a wide variety of<br>
Hadoop related tools and best practices for implementation. Hadoop Real World<br>
Solutions Cookbook will teach readers how to build solutions using tools such as<br>
Apache Hive, Pig, MapReduce, Mahout, Giraph, HDFS, Accumulo, Redis, and<br>
Ganglia. Hadoop Real World Solutions Cookbook provides in depth explanations<br>
and code examples. Each chapter contains a set of recipes that pose, then solve,<br>
technical challenges, and can be completed in any order. A recipe breaks a single<br>
problem down into discrete steps that are easy to follow. The book covers<br>
(un)loading to and from HDFS, graph analytics with Giraph, batch data analysis<br>
using Hive, Pig, and MapReduce, machine learning approaches with Mahout,<br>
debugging and troubleshooting MapReduce, and columnar storage and retrieval of<br>
structured data using Apache Accumulo. Hadoop Real World Solutions Cookbook<br>
will give readers the examples they need to apply Hadoop technology to their own<br>
problems.</p>
