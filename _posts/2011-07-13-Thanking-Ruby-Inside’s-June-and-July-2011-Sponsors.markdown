Thanks!</p>
<p>I take care not to accept sponsors who have little of interest to the Ruby scene so hopefully you'll find something useful below - it's not a roster of faceless companies, these folks are doing great stuff.</p>
<h3>RubyMine by JetBrains - A Powerful Ruby and Rails IDE</h3>
<p><a href="http://engine.adzerk.net/redirect/0/5052/5980/1313/3aae83ff44694987b4f9c899b1bef7f1/19/24/7127/634460548369228611?keywords="><img src="http://www.rubyinside.com/images/rubymine.png" alt="" title="Ruby Mine" width="125" height="125" style="float:right;margin-left:18px;margin-bottom:18px"></a><a href="http://engine.adzerk.net/redirect/0/5052/5980/1313/3aae83ff44694987b4f9c899b1bef7f1/19/24/7127/634460548369228611?keywords=">RubyMine</a> is a cross-platform Ruby and Rails IDE that works with and contains a full stack of essential developer tools, all tightly integrated into a convenient and smart development environment. It includes a debugger, Vi/Vim emulation, support for several version control systems (including Git, Subversion and Mercurial), RVM support, Bundler support, and, of course, "a lot more!" It costs money but.. you can <a href="http://engine.adzerk.net/redirect/0/5052/5980/1313/3aae83ff44694987b4f9c899b1bef7f1/19/24/7127/634460548369228611">download a 30 day free trial</a> right now to see if it's for you.</p>
<p>I'm pretty militant against IDEs and am still rocking the text editor + terminal approach that I know a lot of you also use but all the features that RubyMine's managing to pack in nowadays (and the ever increasing performance of the underlying IDE) is making it pretty tempting nowadays. Worth a go at least.</p>
<h3>RailsKits - Ready Made Rails Code</h3>
<p><a href="http://engine.adzerk.net/redirect/0/4764/5457/1313/ea7c1a740916430b9dc63ece6d134aa5/19/24/6498/634430717830567061?keywords="><img src="http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-shot-2011-07-12-at-16.24.49.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-07-12 at 16.24.49" width="260" height="71" style="float:right;margin-left:18px;margin-bottom:8px"></a><a href="http://engine.adzerk.net/redirect/0/4764/5457/1313/ea7c1a740916430b9dc63ece6d134aa5/19/24/6498/634430717830567061?keywords=">RailsKits</a> is here to bring you great ready-made Rails code for you to use in your projects. More than just plugins, these starter kits can act as the foundation of your new Rails application. You can save hours of time, skipping the boring stuff and diving right into the code that makes your application different from all the rest.</p>
<p>RailsKits recently unveiled the <strong>OAuth Rails Kit</strong> which lets you easily integrate the Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn APIs with your Rails application.</p>
<h3>New Relic — On-demand Application Management</h3>
<p><a href="http://engine.adzerk.net/redirect/0/3130/4002/1313/0794dd2063cb49ca83be4da45fb4beca/19/24/5057/634419132122218342?keywords=">New Relic</a> is a full-stack Java, Ruby, PHP, and soon Python, application performance and management app that started life as a Rails-only service.</p>
<p>New Relic has long dominated the performance monitoring scene, particularly amongst Rails apps (folks like 37signals and Shopify use them heavily), but they've not rested on their laurels. Just a couple of months ago they <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/new-relic-releases-real-user-monitoring-and-ditches-rpm-4828.html">released a Real User Monitoring service</a> which goes right down to the customer experience. How quick pages load, how quick the pages are to render, etc.</p>
<h3>Jumpstart Lab - Rails Training Experts</h3>
<p><a href="http://engine.adzerk.net/redirect/0/4552/4823/1313/d2244e60acc743b18b669b045b0adfa4/19/24/6023/634419131287842817?keywords="><img src="http://www.rubyinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jumpstart.png" alt="" title="jumpstart" width="125" height="125" style="float:right;margin-left:18px"></a><a href="http://engine.adzerk.net/redirect/0/4552/4823/1313/d2244e60acc743b18b669b045b0adfa4/19/24/6023/634419131287842817?keywords=">Jumpstart Lab</a>, headed by Jeff Casimir, is a training company specializing in Ruby on Rails. Their classes are usually two days long and while their prescheduled classes tend to be in Washington DC, where they're based, they'll travel anywhere if you have (or can find) at least six attendees.</p>
<p>Jumpstart calls their training "computer science for normal people" because they jump straight into working on real projects right away and they promise to offer "the best training class you've ever taken, guaranteed."
