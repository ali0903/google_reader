<h3>Backbone Fundamentals</h3>

<p><a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/backbone-fundamentals/">Backbone Fundamentals</a> (GitHub <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals">addyosmani / backbone-fundamentals</a>) by Addy Osmani is a new book that introduces Backbone to beginners, helping to piece together the collection of tools and knowledge required to use it effectively.</p>

<p>It’s still being worked on, but Addy has already written a huge amount that can be read in the GitHub repository’s <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals/blob/master/README.md">Backbone.js Fundamentals README.md</a> file.</p>

<p>There’s also a <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals/issues/3">Backbone Fundamentals wishlist</a> for those wishing to add their own suggestions for the book, or perhaps even help through contributions.</p>

<h3>Boilerplate for Three.js</h3>

<p><a href="http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/12/20/boilerplate-for-three-js/">Boilerplate for Three.js</a> (GitHub <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threejsboilerplate">jeromeetienne / threejsboilerplate</a>) by Jerome Etienne is a template to get started with <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a> development.</p>

<p>It renders WebGL if available, else it’ll fall back to a 2D Canvas. It’ll also create a scene with camera controls, touch event support, fullscreen, window resize, and screenshots.</p>

<h3> zoom.js</h3>

<p><a href="http://lab.hakim.se/zoom-js/">zoom.js</a> (GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/zoom.js">hakimel / zoom.js</a>) by Hakim El Hattab is a small JavaScript API for zooming into a specific point on a page or a DOM element. The author states that it’s an experimental proof-of-concept, but the effect worked well on the browsers I tested it with.</p>

<p>Some browsers will have a more noticeable visual glitch as anti-aliasing is applied, but the effect uses animation easing so it feels relatively gentle considering what’s actually happening behind the scenes.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/dailyjs/~4/phVFAMNexzU" height="1" width="1">
