<h3>original <a href="http://blog.nodejs.org/2012/06/25/node-v0-8-0/">http://blog.nodejs.org/2012/06/25/node-v0-8-0/</a></h3>

<p>I am thrilled to announce the arrival of a new stable version of
Node.js.

</p>


<p>Compared with the v0.6 releases of Node, this release brings significant
improvements in many key performance metrics, as well as
cleanup in several core APIs, and the addition of new debugging
features.

</p>


<h2>tl;dr</h2>


<p>With version 0.8.0:

</p>


<ol>
<li>Node got a lot faster.</li>
<li>Node got more stable.</li>
<li>You can do stuff with file descriptors again.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html">cluster module</a> is much more
awesome.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/domain.html">domain module</a> was added.</li>
<li>The repl is better.</li>
<li>The build system changed from waf to gyp.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/API-changes-between-v0.6-and-v0.8">Some other stuff changed,
too.</a></li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom for the links to install it.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Performance</h2>


<p>This version brings a few key enhancements in V8 and libuv that result
in significantly improved throughput.

</p>


<p>All of these benchmarks were run on my OS X laptop, but the results are
typical of what we&#39;re seeing on SmartOS, Linux, and Windows.

<p>The difference is not small.  If you are writing network programs with
node, and pushing a lot of traffic, you will notice this improvement.

</p>


<p>The speed of reading files got quite a bit faster as well:

</p>


<pre><code># v0.6.19
read the file 110948 times (higher is better)
90141.32 ns per read (lower is better)
11093.69 reads per sec (higher is better)

63217.16 ns per read (lower is better) -29.87%
15818.48 reads per sec (higher is better) +42.59%</code></pre>


<p>And of course, the ubiquitous &#39;hello, world&#39; http server benchmark got
significantly faster, especially for large message sizes:

</p>


<pre><code>$ TYPE=bytes LENGTH=123 bash benchmark/http.sh  2&gt;&amp;1 | grep Req

<p>The more bytes you&#39;re pushing, and the more work you&#39;re doing, the more
win you&#39;ll see with node 0.8 over 0.6.

</p>


<p>The vast majority of the performance boost is due to improvements in V8.
They&#39;ve been very responsive to the needs of the Node.js project.  A lot
of Node&#39;s success is due to being built on such a stellar VM.


</p>


<h2>Build System</h2>


<p>Since its inception Node has used the WAF build system which is a Python
based system similar to SCons.  The Chrome project recently changed to
the GYP meta-build system from SCons. GYP generates Makefiles, Visual
Studio project files, or XCode files depending on the target. V8, being
part of the Chrome project, now defines its build in GYP.  By using GYP,
Node is able to:

</p>


<ul>
<li>integrate with the optimal build system on all platforms,</li>
<li>easily able to integrate V8&#39;s build process into its own, and</li>
<li>define its compilation declaratively for better manageability</li>
</ul>


<p>GYP was used already in Node v0.6 to build on Windows, but now it
defines the build on all platforms. Node is still in the process of
migrating external addon modules to GYP, and node-gyp is included with
npm.  In future releases, node-waf will be officially deprecated.  If
you are currently using a wscript in your addon, please migrate to gyp
as soon as possible.


</p>


<h2>Stabler</h2>


<p>The transition from libev and libeio to libuv in 0.6 was somewhat
destabilizing for many node internals.  The gambit paid off: libuv is
the obvious choice in cross-platform asynchronous IO libraries, and
Node.js is impressively performant on both Windows and Unix.  But it
made the transition from 0.4 to 0.6 was very rocky for a lot of users.
Libuv wasn&#39;t as mature as node, and it showed in those early releases.

</p>


<p>At this point, with very few exceptions, if your v0.6 program doesn&#39;t
run on v0.8, it should be easy and obvious to make whatever changes are
necessary.  Libuv has come a very long way, and Node 0.8 is a simpler
and more efficient machine as a result.

</p>


<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/API-changes-between-v0.6-and-v0.8">migration
wiki</a>
for details on the specific APIs that changed.

</p>


<h2>The Return of File Descriptors</h2>


<p>In Node 0.4, there was a <code>listenFD</code> method that servers could use to
listen on a specific file descriptor that was already bound to a socket
or port. In 0.6, that functionality went away, largely because it was
very Unix-specific, and couldn&#39;t be easily made to work with the new
cross-platform libuv base.

</p>


<p>Since the most common use case for listenFD was as a method for having
servers in multiple node processes share the same underlying handle, the
<code>cluster</code> module was added in its place.  However, this still left a lot
of use cases unaddressed, and was a reason why some people could not use
node 0.6 for their programs.

</p>


<p>In 0.8, we&#39;ve replaced this functionality, as <code>server.listen({ fd:
number })</code>.

</p>


<p>The other feature in node 0.4 that got dropped in 0.6 was the ability to
pass arbitrary file descriptors as a child process&#39;s stdio, using the
<code>customFds</code> array.  In Node 0.6, <code>customFds</code> could be used to inherit
the parent&#39;s stdio handles, but not to pass arbitrary handles or file
descriptors to the child&#39;s stdio.  Also, there was never a way to pass
more than the standard <code>in, out, err</code> trio, so programs that expected
FD 4 to be opened in some specific way were out of luck.

</p>


<p>In 0.8, we&#39;ve added the <code>stdio</code> array on the <code>child_process.spawn</code>
options.  Pass as many file descriptors, handles, etc. as you like, and
the child process will see them as already-opened FDs.

</p>


<h2>More Powerful Cluster</h2>


<p>The cluster module in 0.8 is so much improved over 0.6, it&#39;s basically a
complete rewrite.  The API is mostly backwards compatible, but not
entirely.  (See the <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/API-changes-between-v0.6-and-v0.8">migration
wiki</a>
for details.)

</p>


<p>Barring these very minor API changes, if you were using cluster in 0.6,
then your program will still work, but it&#39;ll be faster and more
well-behaved now.  And if you aren&#39;t taking advantage of the new
features in 0.8&#39;s cluster, you&#39;re really missing out.

</p>


<p>There&#39;s too much even to do it justice here.  Go read <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html">the API
docs</a>.

</p>


<h2>Domains</h2>


<p>The original idea for Domains was a way to join multiple different IO
actions, so that you can have some context when an error occurs.

</p>


<p>Since Ryan discussed the feature with node users at NodeConf Summer Camp
last year, the domains feature has gone through many revisions.  The
problem is fairly well understood, but most attempts to solve it
resulted in serious performance regressions, or uncovered difficult edge
cases.

</p>


<p>What we ended up with in 0.8 is a very stripped-down version of this
idea.  It&#39;s entirely opt-in, with minimal performance impact when it&#39;s
used (and none when it isn&#39;t).  There are a lot of examples in <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/domain.html">the API
documentation</a>, so check them out,
and start handling your crashes smarter.

</p>


<p>The domain module is still experimental.  We are looking forward to your
feedback, so please use it and let us know what you think.

</p>


<h2>Repl, Readline, TTY</h2>


<p>The Repl, Readline, and TTY modules have all had a major facelift.  The
interfaces between these three modules are cleaned up and refactored,
removing a lot of common pain points and making it easier to use for
debugging your programs.

</p>


<p>It may seem minor at times, but a good repl dramatically increases the
quality of the overall experience.  My personal favorites are:

</p>


<ol>
<li>Typing <code>fs</code> or <code>net</code> or <code>path</code> will automatically load the module.</li>
<li>Typing <code>npm install ...</code> will give you a helpful message.</li>
<li>It doesn&#39;t do that stupid thing where long lines wrap and then the
backspace makes it get all confused and crazy.  Instead of that, it
does the right thing.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Looking Forward</h2>


<p>Like other even-numbered version families before it, v0.8 will maintain
API and ABI stability throughout its lifetime.

</p>


<p>The v0.6 release family will continue to see releases for critical
bugfixes and security issues through the end of 2012.  However, it will
not be the main focus of the core team&#39;s attention.

</p>


<p>The v0.9 releases will start in the next couple weeks.  The main focus
of v0.9 will be:

</p>


<ul>
<li>The HTTP implementation - It has seen a lot of real-world use now, but
the http module is in dire need of a cleanup and refactor.  Special
attention will be paid to making the interfaces more consistent,
improve performance, and increase correctness in more edge cases.</li>
<li>The Streams API - The concept of the Stream API is very core to node.
However, it is also (like HTTP) a feature that grew up organically,
and is now in need of a cleanup.  It is currently too hard to get
right, especially regarding error handling.</li>
<li>Libuv Streams - The handle interfaces in libuv are going to be
refactored for added consistency throughout the codebase and across
platforms.</li>
</ul>


<p>Looking past that, there are a few areas where Node.js still has room
for improvement in terms of internal consistency, idiomatic JavaScript
usage, and performance.  None of these are fully-fleshed out ideas yet,
but these are some of the items on our radar:

</p>


<ul>
<li>We ought to move to TypedArrays in favor of Buffers.  Buffers will
continue to work, but since TypedArray is a JavaScript native, it
makes sense to move towards that as the preferred API.</li>
<li>SSL performance leaves much to be desired at the moment.  Node&#39;s
interface with OpenSSL is somewhat naive and leaves a lot of potential
optimization on the table.</li>
<li>The VM module needs massive improvement.  It lacks features required
to emulate a web browser JavaScript context, which means that it is
inadequate.</li>
<li>The Crypto module still uses some very dated APIs.  In 0.8, it can
accept Buffers for many things (finally!) but it still does not
present a Node-like streaming interface.</li>
</ul>


<p>At this point, the scope of Node&#39;s feature set is pretty much locked
down.  We may move things around internally for these cleanup tasks, but
as you can see, there are no major new features planned.  We&#39;ve drawn
our boundaries, and now it&#39;s time to continue focusing on improving
stability and performance of the core, so that more innovation can
happen in <strong>your</strong> programs.

</p>


<p>And now, for those of you who may be wondering what was added since
v0.7.12, your regularly scheduled release announcement:
