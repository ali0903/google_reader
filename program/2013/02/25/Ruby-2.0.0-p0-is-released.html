<h2>What is Ruby 2.0.0</h2>




<h3>New Features</h3>




<p>Some of the highlights:</p>




<ul>
  <li>Language core features
    <ul>
      <li>Keyword arguments, which give flexibility to API design</li>
      <li>Module#prepend, which is a new way to extend a class</li>
      <li>A literal %i, which creates an array of symbols easily</li>
      <li>__dir__, which returns the dirname of the file currently being
executed</li>
      <li>The UTF-8 default encoding, which make many magic comments omissible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Built-in libraries
    <ul>
      <li>Enumerable#lazy and Enumerator::Lazy, for (possibly infinite) lazy
stream</li>
      <li>Enumerator#size and Range#size, for lazy size evaluation</li>
      <li>#to_h, which is a new convention for conversion to Hash</li>
      <li>Onigmo, which is a new regexp engine (a fork of Oniguruma)</li>
      <li>Asynchronous exception handling API</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Debug support
    <ul>
      <li>DTrace support, which enables run-time diagnosis in production</li>
      <li>TracePoint, which is an improved tracing API</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Performance improvements
    <ul>
      <li>GC optimization by bitmap marking</li>
      <li>Kernel#require optimization which makes Rails startup very fast</li>
      <li>VM optimization such as method dispatch</li>
      <li>Float operation optimization</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>




<p>In addition, albeit as an experimental feature, 2.0.0 includes
Refinements, which adds a new concept to Ruby's modularity.</p>




<p>See also NEWS for more features, improvements and details.</p>




<h3>Compatibility</h3>




<p>We have also taken care with the 2.0.0 design to make it compatible with
1.9. It will be easier to migrate from 1.9 to 2.0 than it was from 1.8
to 1.9. (The notable incompatibilities are described later.)</p>




<p>In fact, thanks to the dedicated work of third parties, some popular
applications such as Rails and tDiary have been reported to work on the
release candidate version of 2.0.0.</p>




<h3>Documentation</h3>




<p>We have also made documentation improvements which many rubyists have
requested. We have added a huge amount of rdoc for modules and methods.
2.0.0 will be around 75% documented while 1.9.3 was about 60%. Also, we
have added a description of Ruby's syntax. You can see:</p>




<div><pre><code>ri ruby:syntax
</code></pre></div>




<h3>Stability</h3>




<p>Note that unlike 1.9.0, 2.0.0 IS a stable release, even though its TEENY
is 0. All library authors are strongly recommended to support 2.0.0. As
mentioned above, it will be comparatively easy to migrate from 1.9 to
2.0.</p>




<p>Ruby 2.0.0 is ready for practical use, and will absolutely improve your
Ruby life.</p>




<h2>Notes</h2>




<h3>Introductory articles</h3>




<p>Here are some introductory articles of 2.0.0 features by third parties:</p>

</ul>




<p>The following articles are also helpful, but outdated with regards to
refinement:</p>

  <li><a href="http://globaldev.co.uk/2012/11/ruby-2-0-0-preview-features/">&lt;URL:http://globaldev.co.uk/2012/11/ruby-2-0-0-preview-features/&gt;</a></li>

</ul>




<p>Also, the recent issue of "Rubyist Magazine" includes some articles
that were written by the feature authors themselves for introducing some
new 2.0.0 features.</p>




<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jp.rubyist.net/magazine/?0041-200Special">&lt;URL:http://jp.rubyist.net/magazine/?0041-200Special&gt;</a></li>
</ul>




<p>Though they will be written in Japanese, English translations are
planned for the future.</p>




<h3>Incompatibility</h3>




<p>There are five notable incompatibilities we know of:</p>




<ul>
  <li>The default encoding for ruby scripts is now UTF-8 [#6679]. Some
people report that it affects existing programs, such as some
benchmark programs becoming very slow [ruby-dev:46547].</li>
  <li>Iconv was removed, which had already been deprecated when M17N was
introduced in ruby 1.9. Use String#encode, etc. instead.</li>
  <li>There is ABI breakage [ruby-core:48984]. We think that normal users
can/should just reinstall extension libraries. You should be aware: DO
NOT COPY .so OR .bundle FILES FROM 1.9.</li>
  <li>#lines, #chars, #codepoints, #bytes now returns an Array instead of an
Enumerator [#6670]. This change allows you to avoid the common idiom
"lines.to_a". Use #each_line, etc. to get an Enumerator.</li>
  <li>Object#inspect does always return a string like
#&lt;ClassName:0xâ€¦&gt; instead of delegating to #to_s. [#2152]</li>
</ul>




<p>There are some comparatively small incompatibilities.
[ruby-core:49119]</p>




<h3>Status of Refinements</h3>




<p>We have added a feature called Refinements, which adds a new concept to
Ruby's modularity. However, please be aware that Refinements is still
an experimental feature: we may change its specification in the future.
Despite that, we would like you to play with it and give us your
thoughts. Your feedback will help to forge this interesting feature.</p>




<h2>Acknowledgment</h2>




<p>A great many people contributed to 2.0.0. Even an incomplete
acknowledgment for only a few parts of contributions became too big to
insert here. Sorry but let me just add a link to the special thanks
page.</p>
