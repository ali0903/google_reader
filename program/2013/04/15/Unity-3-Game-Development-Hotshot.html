<p>Only Unity fits the bill of being a game engine that allows you to create a full 3D game for<br>
free, and with phenomenal community support. This book will equip you with the skills to<br>
create professional looking games at no cost.</p>


<p>Unity 3 Game Development Hotshot will teach you how to exploit the full array of Unity<br>
3D’s technology in order to create an advanced gaming experience for the user, with eight<br>
exciting and challenging projects that provide a step-by-step explanation, diagrams, and<br>
screenshots to help you achieve that goal.</p>


<p>Every project is designed to push your Unity skills to the very limits and beyond. You will<br>
create a hero/heroine which will be used in an RPG game. You will create a menu for the RPG<br>
game allowing you to customize your character with powerups, armor, and weapons. You<br>
will shade, model, rig, and animate your hero/heroine, so that they start to look more like a<br>
character from Final Fantasy than a simple sprite.</p>


<p>Now for some damage—rocket launchers! Typically the most powerful weapon in any first-<br>
person shooter, you will create a rocket launcher that has fire and smoke particles and<br>
most importantly causes splash damage for that all-important area effect. You will create<br>
AI-controlled enemies for your hero/heroine to eliminate the rocket launcher. We will create<br>
an interactive world that is destructible, so if the rocket launchers miss their target they will<br>
damage the surrounding environment. Finally, you learn to save and load so you can take a<br>
break from the action for life’s necessities like going to the bathroom. The final touch will be<br>
for you to upload your scores online so everyone can see the carnage.</p>


<p><strong>Who this book is for</strong></p>


<p>This book is for users who already have some basic knowledge of how to use the Unity<br>
game engine and intermediate users who want to explore Unity above and beyond the basic<br>
techniques.</p>
